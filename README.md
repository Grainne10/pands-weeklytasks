# pands-weeklytasks

**by Grainne Boyle**

I work at [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html)

I am a student at the [Atlantic Technological University] (https://www.atu.ie/), Galway, studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics on a part-time basis over 2 years.

This Read Me file is for the Programming and Scripting Year 1 module . It describes the weekly tasks and explains how I solved them and what research I did . I will also reference resources that I used to come to the solution.

I do not have previous coding experience. This first semester has been challenging while I learn completely new topics, work full-time and manage life in general.
